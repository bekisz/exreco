# exreco
Exreco is a agent based platform for the simulation and study of the Darwinian evolutionary process.  It aims to support the exploration of genetically rooted phenomena like  - aging (programmed cell death) - sexual and asexual reproduction  - altruism of individuals - spread of diseases  The typical way of using Exreco starts by defining the behavior of your replicators ( agents that can reproduce and evolve over time), and defining the environment of these replicators. If it is all done you can let it run observing what kind of genes prevail over time. The tool typically runs the same world (experiment scenario) over and over again to have a statistical understanding of the various replicator strategies.
